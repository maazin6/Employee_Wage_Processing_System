# Employee_Wage_Processing_System
I created an Employee wage processing system using python and MySQL. It uses the total hours worked by an employee including the various overtime hours worked. It calculates the salary of an employee using the basic salary rate and different overtime rates and stores the data in the respective database.

It displays 3 different menus based on the role of the user(User, Admin, Manager).

The user and manager have limited access to the different functions while the admin has access to all the functions.

To access the application the employee needs to enter his employee id along with his password, if the user id and password correspond with the data stored in the database, the employee will be given a menu corresponding to his role.
